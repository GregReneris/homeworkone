        <p id="aboutmetext">My name is Greg Reneris. I'm a coding boot camp student right now, and I'm excited to work
            in the future as a web developer.
            My hobbies are tennis, skiing, and travel. I want to help make a positive impact and change in the world.

            Growing up in Bellevue Washington, I've seen how dramatically technolgy has changed daily life over the past
            20 years, and there really is no time like the present to learn more and get involved.
            <br>
            <br>
            While working at Microsoft and Amazon artificial intelligence and data analytics were hugely important to
            making informed business decisions. When I complete this course and enter the workforce, I look forward to
            helping businesses grow with technology.
